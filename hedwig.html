      <p class="charac-msg" style="font-size:29px;">Hey Shruti! Hapieeeeee happyyy birthdayyyyyyyy🥳🥳 <br />
I wish I could come to your party...but I don't want to😂😂 <br />
So am sending this message😁<br />
You know Shruti the most important thing is to 'Be Yourself' , no matter what others think or say how awkward, weird or wrong a thing is, it should not matter to you, just listen to yourself and what you want, never let ross or anyone else influece what you believe in, they are your thoughts, take a stand for them, no matter how silly it sounds. People will judge you, try to bring you down coz that's what their job is, so don't make their job easy by being what they want you to be, first accept yourself ,stop judging yourself, whatever you are, you are PERFECT, leave this undermining job to these people only💁.<br />
There will also be people who will accept you for what you are and those are the ones who matter and never take them from granted coz people are gonna come and go..but these are the ones who are for life😌<br />
Also Shruti sometimes not having a plan is alright, at one time I did not even had a 'pla'...😂  just hang in there, life will show you the way, you will figure it out.<br />
Your childish nature kind of matches with me and that is very sweet. Always keep that child within you, that way you will enjoy everything more.<br />
And lastly you know whenever I am sad ,in a bad mood,confused ,stuck whatever, joey is there for me and the good thing is you got your joey too😉😉 he will never let you go down just believe in him😉😉<br />
Just enjoy every moment to the fullest, for guitar lessons you can contact me and uuuu uuuu Be Good To Animals.❤️❤️</p>

<h1 class="charac-msg" style="color:#5d366d;">Message From Ross</h1>
    <p class="charac-msg"style="font-size:29px;">Hii........<br />
Happy birthday Shruti 🤗🤗<br />
Btw have you seen my sandwich? I left it here with a note, there was a very funny joke written on it. Anyways, if you find it let me know coz it is 'MY SANDWICH'!!<br />
I know you don't like me alot but I hope you understand how I feel about rachel....well leave it, I don't want to whine about that on your birthday...<br />
So my message for you...<br />
You know I was the most mature one in the group...yeah I made dinosaur noices in class and dated my student but neglect those things hehe...<br />
The thing is you should always consider what others feel, what they want, sometimes you intend right but it ends up horribly ( you know how I messed up with rachel and the whole break thing🤦‍♂️), and I know you are very considerate person, stay like that.<br />
The main thing I want  to say that never leave hope...journey may be very difficult but you always reach your destination...(no spoilers😛)<br />
If there is a relationship on a brink, go on a extra mile to save it, donot throw it away, not all are lucky to get second chances...<br />You know what is good thing about us? We always tell the truth, give honest opinion and tells what is the right thing to do...yeah sometimes it hurts other's feeling but you know somebody has to tell the truth,what is right and no stranger gonna come and tell them...right?<br />
So Shruti no matter how many heartbreaks you face, be brave, you will find the right one eventually it's just the matter of time...<br />
In the end I would just like to add that...'WE WERE ON A BREAK'!!</p>

<h1 class="charac-msg" style="color:#5d366d;">Message From Joey</h1>
  <p class="charac-msg"style="font-size:29px;">Hey shruuuu 😉 How You Doin'?😉😉 <br />
So what do you say, let's go for a coffee sometime 😉, just tell me whenever you are free🤗<br />
And if you are busy, is your mom free?😝 Just kidding 😂..give me her number I will ask myself😝..yeah kidding again, c'mon get some sense of humour😂<br />
So my message....<br />
I wanna say that life is tough Shruti, there is alot of struggle in like everything. You know I have faced alot of rejections, I mean 'ALOT'😂, but I did not leave my passion, everytime I tried to become better. You will also have to face rejection somewhere in your life, but never let your self confidence down, take it as a reality check that how much you have to improve, and one day when you will achieve what you always wanted, you will understand how important these rejections were for your success.😌<br />
Now let's talk about Chandler's betrayal by being with Kathy😡<br />
No no we are not going to bitch about chandler😂 but I want to say that sometimes our friends can make a mistake, even our closest ones...they are also human beings, the thing is you should forgive them coz you know they never intend wrong to you😌 Sometime you may also make a mistake and they will be angry at you but you know they will forgive you coz you matter to them alot and they don't want one mistake to ruin everything they have with you...no matter how big the mistake is..it's just not worth it.<br /> In the end I just want to mention a french saying which helped alot in my life and am sure will help you too, and it goes as "Bleu de la blu bli blu ble, ba ble blu bla "☺</p>

<h1 class="charac-msg" style="color:#5d366d;">Message From Rachel</h1>

  <p class="charac-msg"style="font-size:26.5px;">Hey Shruti...<br />
Is today your birthday? Noooooooooooo😳<br />
Okay sorry I forgot and therefore I am making a Trifle for your birthday 😉...all of my friends likes it alot😌<br />
I have a big message for you Shruti coz you and me...we are very much alike😌<br />
Becoming independent was the toughest thing I had to do, I was so afraid with no plan, I literally had a panic attack but you know I had my magic beans...they made my transition very easy, always supported me and were there every moment of my life..so always keeps your magic beans close to you, never lose them😉<br />
I hope you understand how important it is to be not dependent on anyone else,no one is gonaa spoon feed you forever, you need to take control of your life, you have to start taking tough decisions because you know you are always one decision away from a totally different life😌.<br />
And it is hard..in the start you may have to do a job which you don't want to and where you will learn nothing and feel like stuck there but you will be afraid to leave it because you donot have any other plans...take the risk Shruti..follow what you want...it's okay to be confused..totally...you can ask for help, some people will  always be ready, you are not alone ,never feel that.<br />
Another thing I want to say that sometimes being selfish is not so selfish...in priority list you comes first than anyone else so do what is favourable to you and just don't go on sacrificing for others all the time. Being sensitive and emotional is fine too...it does not make you weak, okay..crying is very normal, even guys who pretend to be tough cry at times, so never feel inferior, you just have more emotions which others don't feel, don't let anyone ridicule you.Live  your life the way you want to..go out in real world and face it, there is a piece of advice I first got when I started my new life I am passing it to you..."The real world sucks...You are going to love it."😉 And with the friends you have got... everything will be easy😉</p>

<h1 class="charac-msg" style="color:#5d366d;">Message From Monica</h1>
  <p class="charac-msg"style="font-size:26.8px;">Hey Shruti happy birthday ❤️<br />
I heard you are a chef too? We should compete what do you say? Let's find out who is the best😎 I am😎<br />
Do you also feel bad that you love to cook too much but can not eat everything because of weight stress? Isn't that annoying? I KNOW!!<br />
So this is what I want to say Shruti...don't stress about your weight, it is the last thing that matters, eat as much as you want ..yea if you want to be slim work harder...don't compromise on eating...candies, non-veg, chocolate this is life😌<br />
And that's not the only thing we have in common you know, we are both very competitive also...we both want to be the best but the thing you need to learn is to fight...you will never be the best at anything until you are willing to put that extra effort after you are too exhausted to continue... complete the job you commit to..don't back off because everything becomes boring at one point we can not leave everything because of that right?<br />
Secondly, never doubt yourself...you can do anything and everything and also don't be self conscious...people may feel you are not good enough sometimes they may be your family member but don't let them define you...prove everyone wrong...being fat or not...you are always beautiful and you know I was cuter when I was fat🤗<br />
There will be a guy who will accept you the way you are, for whom you are not weird even if you think you are and who  donot want any change in you and that's the guy you need to find...he maybe just in front of you all this time, the thing is you are just not looking...I am telling you Shruti you will find your chan chan man and you may feel that you can fight everything yourself but you don't have to...he will make your fight easier, happy moments happier and sad moments funnier😉 You don't have to be alone😌<br />
Wait for some moment, you will have a life that you deserve😉</p>

  <p class="charac-msg"style="font-size:30px;">Helluu shrutii😉<br />
Could it BE more Happy Birthday ❤️❤️<br />
First tell me was joey bitching bout me?😡 I hope not I will kill him...<br />
So now I have to write a message for you ehhh...like you didn't get them enough already🤦‍♂️...yeah sarcasm is my thing, bear it😂 or not I don't care😂 I am not good at advices, can I interest you in sarcastic comment😝<br />
You know what's similar between us? We are the ones who people come first to...because we are always there to listen and help...am proud of you for that😉<br />
But don't forget one thing while helping others is that you should also stay happy...not everytime you will have a reason to smile, you will have to create it yourself so keep smiling no matter what life throws at you...and you have a very beautiful smile😍.<br />
I was always afraid of commitment you know, I never always ran away from it but that's the lesson I have learnt in my life...don't be afraid...with the right person, who understands you more than you do yourself, it will never be tough, just take I step further and that person will pull you to the other side and I know it seems scary now but in reality it's very beautiful ☺️<br />
Be responsible Shruti...take responsibility of your actions and be more cute😝 (yeah that was sarcasm too coz can you BE more cute😍)</p>
